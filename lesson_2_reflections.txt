REFLECTION #2.1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

			This is what gets git involved... without initializing, there is no version-control.

REFLECTION #2.2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

			The staging area is an intermediary location or flag of some sort (probably inside the /.git directory) that tells git to track changes inside files. The working directory is where those changes are made. The repository is where those changes are ultimately tracked.

	
HIERARCHY IN REPOS

	1) Working Directory (what you're doing)
	2) Staging Area (what you want to commit)
	3) Commit 1 (most recent commit)
	4) Commit xyz (old commits)

REFLECTION #2.4 - What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

			branches are good for any new idea or thought (or context) and allow you to be more free with your creativity
