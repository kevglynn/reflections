REFLECTION #3.1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

      		1. Universal access (wifi dependent, but very good access)
      		2. Collaboration purposes
			3. Opening/publicizing open-source type work

REFLECTION #3.2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

			I don't know... it seems to make sense that github should not automatically update... but why not git?

				git [local repo] staying behind github [remote repo] would make sense, though if you were making multiple changes and wanted a chance to attain the old 'logical change' concept before pulling the changes down the the local repo.

REFLECTION #3.3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

			forks are on github and represent what has been pushed to the cloud

			clones are local repos, representing copies of other repos (either local or remote/github)

			branches represent unique trains of thought on a local repo

REFLECTION #3.4 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

			knowning what was last pushed to or pulled from github helps keeping track of what you share to the remote. Without this feature, you would be operating blindly on the part that is most public and therefore higher stakes

REFLECTION #3.5 - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

			HOW
				- emails with documentation and explanation
				- something like (or using) google docs for code
			EASIER
				- less fiddling with CLI
				- fewer steps... maybe? sometimes it feels like lots of commands to get these things to happen
			HARDER
				- less control?
				- unweildy
